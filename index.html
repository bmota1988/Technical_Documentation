      <h1>Introdution</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the mechanics of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas)
      and
      the forces on them. It has applications in a wide range of disciplines, including mechanical, civil, chemical
      and
      biomedical engineering, geophysics, oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, and biology.</p>
    <p>It can be divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest; and fluid dynamics, the study of the effect
      of
      forces on fluid motion. It is a branch of continuum mechanics, a subject which models matter without using the
      information that it is made out of atoms; that is, it models matter from a macroscopic viewpoint rather than
      from
      microscopic. Fluid mechanics, especially fluid dynamics, is an active field of research, typically
      mathematically
      complex. Many problems are partly or wholly unsolved and are best addressed by numerical methods, typically
      using
      computers. A modern discipline, called computational fluid dynamics (CFD), is devoted to this approach. Particle
      image velocimetry, an experimental method for visualizing and analyzing fluid flow, also takes advantage of the
      highly visual nature of fluid flow.</p><br />

      <h1>Fluid Statics</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Fluid statics or hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies fluids at rest. It embraces the
      study
      of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium; and is contrasted with fluid dynamics,
      the
      study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life, such
      as
      why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, why wood and oil float on water, and why the surface of water is
      always level whatever the shape of its container. Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics, the engineering of
      equipment for storing, transporting and using fluids. It is also relevant to some aspects of geophysics and
      astrophysics (for example, in understanding plate tectonics and anomalies in the Earth's gravitational field),
      to
      meteorology, to medicine (in the context of blood pressure), and many other fields.</p><br />

      <h1>Fluid Dynamics</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Fluid dynamics is a subdiscipline of fluid mechanics that deals with fluid flow—the science of liquids and
      gases
      in motion. Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these practical disciplines—that
      embraces
      empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and used to solve practical problems. The
      solution
      to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves calculating various properties of the fluid, such as velocity,
      pressure, density, and temperature, as functions of space and time. It has several subdisciplines itself,
      including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in
      motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and movements on
      aircraft,
      determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting evolving weather patterns,
      understanding
      nebulae in interstellar space and modeling explosions. Some fluid-dynamical principles are used in traffic
      engineering and crowd dynamics.</p><br />

  <section class="main-section" id="assumptions">
    <header>
      <h1>Assumptions</h1>
    </header>
    <p>The assumptions inherent to a fluid mechanical treatment of a physical system can be expressed in terms of
      mathematical equations. Fundamentally, every fluid mechanical system is assumed to obey:</p>
    <li>Conservation of mass</li>
    <li>Conservation of energy</li>
    <li>Conservation of momentum</li>
    <li>The continuum assumption</li>
    <p>For example, the assumption that mass is conserved means that for any fixed control volume (for example, a
      spherical volume)—enclosed by a control surface—the rate of change of the mass contained in that volume is equal
      to the rate at which mass is passing through the surface from outside to inside, minus the rate at which mass is
      passing from inside to outside. This can be expressed as an equation in integral form over the control volume.
    </p>
    <p>The continuum assumption is an idealization of continuum mechanics under which fluids can be treated as
      continuous, even though, on a microscopic scale, they are composed of molecules. Under the continuum assumption,
      macroscopic (observed/measurable) properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and bulk velocity are taken
      to be well-defined at "infinitesimal" volume elements—small in comparison to the characteristic length scale of
      the system, but large in comparison to molecular length scale. Fluid properties can vary continuously from one
      volume element to another and are average values of the molecular properties. The continuum hypothesis can lead
      to
      inaccurate results in applications like supersonic speed flows, or molecular flows on nano scale. Those
      problems for which the continuum hypothesis fails can be solved using statistical mechanics. To determine
      whether
      or not the continuum hypothesis applies, the Knudsen number, defined as the ratio of the molecular mean free
      path
      to the characteristic length scale, is evaluated. Problems with Knudsen numbers below 0.1 can be evaluated using
      the continuum hypothesis, but molecular approach (statistical mechanics) can be applied for all ranges of
      Knudsen
      numbers.</p><br />

      <h1>Navier Stokes Equations</h1>
    </header>
    <p>The Navier–Stokes equations (named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes) are differential
      equations that describe the force balance at a given point within a fluid. For an incompressible fluid with

      here. Occasionally, body forces, such as the gravitational force or Lorentz force are added to the equations.
    </p>
    <p>Solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations for a given physical problem must be sought with the help of calculus.
      In practical terms, only the simplest cases can be solved exactly in this way. These cases generally involve
      non-turbulent, steady flow in which the Reynolds number is small. For more complex cases, especially those
      involving turbulence, such as global weather systems, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and many more, solutions of
      the
      Navier–Stokes equations can currently only be found with the help of computers. This branch of science is called
      computational fluid dynamics.</p><br />

    <p>An inviscid fluid has no viscosity,<code>&nbsp<img

      In practice, an inviscid flow is an idealization, one that facilitates mathematical treatment. In fact, purely
      inviscid flows are only known to be realized in the case of superfluidity. Otherwise, fluids are generally
      viscous, a property that is often most important within a boundary layer near a solid surface, where the flow
      must
      match onto the no-slip condition at the solid. In some cases, the mathematics of a fluid mechanical system can
      be
      treated by assuming that the fluid outside of boundary layers is inviscid, and then matching its solution onto
      that for a thin laminar boundary layer.</p>
    <p>For fluid flow over a porous boundary, the fluid velocity can be discontinuous between the free fluid and the
      fluid in the porous media (this is related to the Beavers and Joseph condition). Further, it is useful at low
      subsonic speeds to assume that gas is incompressible—that is, the density of the gas does not change even though
      the speed and static pressure change.</p><br />

      <h1>Equations for a Newtonian Fluid</h1>
    </header>
    <p>A Newtonian fluid (named after Isaac Newton) is defined to be a fluid whose shear stress is linearly
      proportional
      to the velocity gradient in the direction perpendicular to the plane of shear. This definition means regardless
      of
      the forces acting on a fluid, it continues to flow. For example, water is a Newtonian fluid, because it
      continues
      to display fluid properties no matter how much it is stirred or mixed. A slightly less rigorous definition is
      that
      the drag of a small object being moved slowly through the fluid is proportional to the force applied to the
      object. (Compare friction). Important fluids, like water as well as most gases, behave—to good approximation—as
      a
      Newtonian fluid under normal conditions on Earth.</p>
    <p>By contrast, stirring a non-Newtonian fluid can leave a "hole" behind. This will gradually fill up over
      time—this
      behavior is seen in materials such as pudding, oobleck, or sand (although sand isn't strictly a fluid).
      Alternatively, stirring a non-Newtonian fluid can cause the viscosity to decrease, so the fluid appears
      "thinner"
      (this is seen in non-drip paints). There are many types of non-Newtonian fluids, as they are defined to be
      something that fails to obey a particular property—for example, most fluids with long molecular chains can react
      in a non-Newtonian manner.</p>
    <p>The constant of proportionality between the viscous stress tensor and the velocity gradient is known as the
      viscosity. A simple equation to describe incompressible Newtonian fluid behavior is</p>

      is the second viscosity coefficient (or bulk viscosity). If a fluid does not obey this relation, it is termed a
      non-Newtonian fluid, of which there are several types. Non-Newtonian fluids can be either plastic, Bingham
      plastic, pseudoplastic, dilatant, thixotropic, rheopectic, viscoelastic.</p>
    <p>In some applications, another rough broad division among fluids is made: ideal and non-ideal fluids. An ideal
      fluid is non-viscous and offers no resistance whatsoever to a shearing force. An ideal fluid really does not
      exist, but in some calculations, the assumption is justifiable. One example of this is the flow far from solid
      surfaces. In many cases, the viscous effects are concentrated near the solid boundaries (such as in boundary
      layers) while in regions of the flow field far away from the boundaries the viscous effects can be neglected and
      the fluid there is treated as it were inviscid (ideal flow). When the viscosity is neglected, the term
      containing
      the viscous stress tensor &nbsp<img
